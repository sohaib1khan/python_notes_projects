# Nested if statement
# in python you can use 'if' and 'elif' statements to create a nested strcuture of condition

# example 1: 

x = 5

# if x > 0:
#     print("x is positive")
#     if x < 10:
#         print("x is less than 10")
#     elif x < 20:
#         print("x is between 10 and 20")
#     else:
#         print("x is greater than or equal to 20")
# else:
#     print("x us non-positive")
