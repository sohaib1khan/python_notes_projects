# Variables: variables are container that store data/key values. 

# few examples of variables 

# x = "A"
# print(x)
# y = "B"
# print(y)

# name = input(" What is your name? ")
# length = len(name)
# print(length)


# # Casting: meaning if you want to specify the variable with certains data type
# a = str("1,2,3,4,5")
# b = int(1)
# c = float(1)

# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))
# print(type(c))




# Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.


# User input anything
# a = input("a: ")
# b = input("b: ")

# print("a: " + b)
# print("b: " + a)



your_name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello " + your_name+"," + " How are you today?")
