# string manipulation 

# Write multiple print statements in one line

# print("print statement1\nprint statement2\nprint statement3")

# the backslash '\' and 'n' means a new line. Having a space(s) after the '\n' will reflect the output.

# print("I have no space\n i'm one spacebar tab from the begining\nI have no spacebar tab!")


# concatenate two separate statements as one. Using a single quote will insert space between 2 separate statements. 
# Another way would be to add space in the begininging of the second statement.

# without space between 2 statesments 
# print("Hello" "User")

# with space between 2 statesments 
# print("Hello"' '"User")
# print("Hello"" User")
