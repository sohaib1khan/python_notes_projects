# In python scripts, you can allow user's input. That means in the code you can ask user making selection to option A,B,C 

# Using a var 
# username = input("What is your name? ")
# print("Hi, how is it going? " + username)

# With print 
# print("hello " + input("What is your name? "))



# This example take the input and count the letters. example of asking a name
char_in_name = input("What is your name? ")
print("There are " + str(len(char_in_name)) + " letters in your name")

# another way of writing this is,
# print(len(input("what is your name? ")))
